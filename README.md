Here's a starting place if you want to build a WebSockets app in Python.

It uses:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (a small web framework)
* [gevent-socketio](https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio) (a simple way to get websockets)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (frontend toolkit from Twitter)

Much of the frontend boilerplate originally came from [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/).

To use this, install Flask and gevent-socketio, then run `python server.py`.
